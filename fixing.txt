Got it. Quick plan: confirm whether add_filter.py is referenced at runtime and point out where its changes appear in sales2.py.

Not imported: add_filter.py is not imported or referenced anywhere in sales2.py. It was a one-time helper script used to modify the file.
Inline function: The remove_zero_values() function now lives directly in sales2.py (under the “HELPER FUNCTION” section) and is used at runtime.
Where it’s used:
Quarter Comparison: Filters compare_chart after grouping on Year and ActAmt.
Business Analysis: Filters month_act (ActAmt), month_cn (CNAmt), and month_total after TotalAmt is computed.
Product–Month: Filters agg_df (ActAmt) for both “Month-wise” and “Yearly” views.
Safe cleanup: Since there’s no runtime dependency on add_filter.py, you can delete that file if you don’t plan to re-run the patching script.
